# Overview

This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing COVID-19 mortality data. The project aims to provide insights into trends, demographics, and factors influencing COVID-19-related deaths using publicly available data sources.

# Data Sources

The analysis primarily uses the following data sources:

COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University: Provides daily updates on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide.

World Health Organization (WHO) and national health ministries: Additional data sources for specific countries or regions.

# Features

Data Retrieval: Scripts (data_retrieval.py) to fetch the latest COVID-19 mortality data from reliable sources.

Data Cleaning: Processes (data_cleaning.py) to clean and preprocess raw data for consistency and accuracy.

Statistical Analysis: Tools (statistical_analysis.py) to perform statistical tests and calculations on mortality rates and associated factors.

Visualization: Generates graphs and charts (visualization.py) to visualize trends and insights from the data.

Machine Learning Models (Optional): Includes scripts (ml_models.py) for building predictive models to understand mortality risk factors.
